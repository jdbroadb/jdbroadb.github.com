## My Background
I am a full-time engineer who has a basic understanding of programming. I regularly work with Matlab, VHDL, and C/C++. However, I'm not a developer and don't regularly write my own code. I've had a longtime interest in web development but haven't created websites since I was in my teens. I've owned an iPhone since 2009 and have been itching to develop an app since I bought it.  I've decided it's time to start doing both.

## Why now?
About a year ago (Feb 2012) I bought my first domain name and shared hosting account. I started playing with [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) but haven't really done too much. And then about 6 months ago (Aug 2012) I bought my first Mac computer. An 11" MacBook Air. For the first time iOS app development was a possibility. Since then I've read a few books on web and iOS development and I'm ready to get started.

## Why start a blog?
In the past 6-12 months I've learned a lot but only started scratching the surface. Startup time can be slow when learning brand new technologies so my hope is to document what I'm learning and hopefully help others get over the hurtle of starting.  I'm also hoping the blog will help me become a better learner.  Properly documenting something requires a certain level of understanding which is hard to fake.  My goal is to ensure that I am aware of what I've learned so that I can incorporate that knowledge into future learning.  This is the spirit of this blog and the origin of the name, Coherent Iterations.

## What to expect
At Coherent Iterations I'll be trying to document everything I learn about iOS and web development.  I'll write about the new technologies I learn, methods for being productive, reviews of the tools and resources I try, and links to helpful places around the Internet. This is also my personal blog and so you can expect me to occasionally share other fun things I find.

Thanks again for visiting Coherent Iterations and please come back regularly as I'll be making regular updates.  You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jdbroadb) or [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/jbro) and subscribe to my [RSS feed](/rss) for the blog.
