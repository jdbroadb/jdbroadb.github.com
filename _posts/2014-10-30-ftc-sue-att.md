> “AT&T promised its customers ‘unlimited’ data, and in many instances, it has failed to deliver on that promise,” said Ramirez in a statement. “The issue here is simple: ‘unlimited’ means unlimited.”

As an unlimited  data customer I'll be very interested to see where this goes. I've held onto the unlimited data instead of dropping for other services like tethering. If something comes of this then I'll be happy I have.
