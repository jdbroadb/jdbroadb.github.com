>Alongside support for CarPlay, AirDrop sharing, and quicker access to a play button in the Stations view, Podcasts 2.1 comes with native Siri support

This was all the reason I needed to consider switching from [Downcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downcast/id393858566?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lqks&at=10lqks) which has been my podcasts player for a couple years now. It's a great feature full app but I've found I need only a few things out of my podcast player:

* Playlists
* Custom Play Order
* 2x Playback

And that's been about it. Without those features it's not usable for me but the addition of Siri integration (along with those features) may tip the scales because I listen to 90% of my podcasts in the car. Hopefully Siri access for developers is announced in a couple weeks to level the playing field.
