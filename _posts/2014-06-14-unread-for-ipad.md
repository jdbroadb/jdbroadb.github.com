> You can navigate anywhere in the app from the edges of the screen. There’s no need to constantly reposition your hands. Just sit back and read your favorite online writers wherever you’re most comfortable.

Unread is my favorite RSS reader on the iPhone, and I've been eager for the iPad release. I really enjoy Jared's design focus for the app and always enjoy the design articles he posts on his blog.
