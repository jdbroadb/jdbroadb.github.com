About two years ago I bought my first shared web hosting and started playing around with websites. Since then I've launched two sites: one "Authority" site that I haven't disclosed and this blog. I spent a bunch of time setting them up and learning Wordpress, but haven't done much with them since.

A big reason I haven't concentrated on the sites as much is because about 1.5 years ago I started learning Objective-C. Since then I've started a handful of iOS projects but they're all at various stages and none close to release.

So it's now May of 2014 and I have a handful of partial projects. I've learned *a ton* in the last two years and now have more ideas than I have time to handle. I really want to be at the point that I'm developing *and releasing* software projects, but I keep thinking of something new or exciting to learn about or experiment with. I need to focus.

I have (what I'd consider) a big idea that involves an iOS app and potentially a server side component. I'm very excited about it, but it's overwhelming and I don't feel that I'm prepared to take it to the end yet. I still have too much to learn.

I've never deployed either an iOS app or a server side app. I think I need to learn the basics before jumping into my big project. To do that I've decided to bite off smaller projects. One iOS and one server but they'll be independent and have limited scope. My intent is to learn the basics from start to finish. Learn the pitfalls and learn what I really don't know. Hopefully at the end I'll feel better prepared for my big idea and at a minimum I'll have a few apps that are at least useful to me.

While it may be silly, I'm going to work on them simultaneously. And I'm going to document what I learn here.  I think that writing things out and discussing them here will help me work out problems and keep me focused. At the end of this I hope to accomplish a few goals:

* Release an iOS app to the App Store
* Deploy a server side app on a self-managed VPS
* Write a lot on this blog about what I learn from both of the other goals

Because neither project is my big idea, neither is earth shattering. This has the benefit that I feel comfortable discussing everything about the projects here. I'll be starting a blog post series to cover each and I hope to be posting a lot starting right away.
