title: iMessage Reliability

My family heavily uses iMessage, using multiple group conversations to talk constantly. I've never had to think twice about iMessage reliability. I assumed all my messages were received and that I was getting everything sent to me. And iMessage hadn't given me reason to suspect otherwise.

Recently something changed. We've started experiencing dropped messages. Some people get messages while others don't. And they aren't just delayed, they're **never** received. This destroys the conversation and makes you constantly start questioning the service when you don't understand a message.

> Are they referring to something I missed or do I just not understand what they're saying?

This has only been over the last few weeks, but it's happened multiple times to multiple family members. Hopefully this isn't a sign that Apple's getting overloaded with the scale of iMessages. And hopefully it gets corrected **soon**.
