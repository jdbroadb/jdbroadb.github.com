> There are just 3 iOS devices in the Blanc family: my iPhone, my wife’s iPhone, and my iPad. They’re signed in with the same Apple ID for the store, and with our own Apple ID for email and calendar. It works great… for now.

I have the same number of devices as Shawn and actually use the same approach. We've used it for years with no issue, and I've recommended it to numerous family members. I looked into Family Sharing in the Fall, but quickly decided it wasn't for us for one major limitation, no iTunes Match.  If I can only share the iTunes purchases, and not my full library, then it's a deal breaker.
