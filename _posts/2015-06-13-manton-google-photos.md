> My family photos are the most important files I have on my computer, and I very rarely share any photos of my kids publicly. But ironically Iâ€™m willing to overlook some of the privacy concerns around this exactly because the photos are so valuable to me. I want multiple copies in the cloud, and I want the power of search that Google has built.

I have to agree with Manton. I'm almost done loading all our photos into Google Photos and I'm very impressed. The search is amazing and only promises to get better.
