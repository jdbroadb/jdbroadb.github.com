## [2013: The Year 'the Stream' Crested](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/2013-the-year-the-stream-crested/282202/)

> The necessity of nowness plus the professionalization of content production for the stream means that there are thousands and thousands of people churning out more crap than can possibly be imagined.

My issue with the Stream, and it's over emphasis on nowness, is the de-emphasis on accuracy. My hope is that this shift or rebalancing that has started results in content creators caring more about getting it right instead of being first.
