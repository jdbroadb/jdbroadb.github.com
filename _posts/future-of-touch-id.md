I ordered a new iPhone 5s on Friday which I expect to receive on Monday. One of the features I'm really excited about is Touch ID. I've always used a 4 digit pass code because I hate unlocking my phone but want to be somewhat security conscious. So the idea of quickly unlocking my phone based on my fingerprint sounds awesome. And from everything I've read ([Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c), [Dalrymple](http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/09/17/review-iphone-5c-and-iphone-5s/)) it works really well. But what really excites me is the future possibilities.

## The True One Password

Using my fingerprint to unlock my phone is great. And using it for accessing my Apple ID account is even better. But what would be truly awesome is if it accessed my password keychain and allowed me to log into anywhere I've saved my password. I hate typing passwords but even more so when on my phone. This could eliminate that need. Assuming it's actually secure.

## Security

Everything I've read has said how well Touch ID works but mostly they've spoken about the reliability of the phone unlocking.  That is the likelihood of false negatives. However, the important factor for security is the likelihood of false positives. I'm sure studies will start to come out now that Touch ID is freely available (please share if you find any) but that will determine how widespread the applications are for Touch ID.

## iCloud Keychain

> And with iCloud Keychain, you no longer have to remember user names, passwords, and credit card information. It does all that for you, and thanks to 256-bit AES encryption, it’s highly secure. [[Apple iOS Page](http://www.apple.com/ios/what-is/)]

But let's assume it works great and Touch ID expands to keychain access on my phone. I'll certainly want that capability everywhere and half the equation could be here very soon. iCloud Keychain is a new iOS 7 feature that didn't make the initial public release but we can expect in the near future. So now I can access all my passwords on all devices and conceivably use my fingerprint everywhere Touch ID is available. Near term that includes iPhones and presumably iPads in a couple months. But what about MacBooks.

## Apples Roadmap

The issue with using the feature on MacBooks is the security. Touch ID uses the new A7 chip with the [Secure Enclave](http://www.quora.com/Apple-Secure-Enclave/What-is-Apple’s-new-Secure-Enclave-and-why-is-it-important). The A7 is ARM based, and there is no comparable piece of hardware available in the Intel based MacBooks. So one of two things must happen to put Touch ID on a MacBook. Either Apple will need to develop a support chip for Touch ID that interacts with Intel based chips OR the MacBooks would need to move to ARM based processors designed by Apple. The latter is something many people have started talking about since it was announced that the A7 was 64-bit. I have no idea what Apple's answer will be, but it certainly raises interesting questions about Apple's future roadmap. What are your thoughts?
