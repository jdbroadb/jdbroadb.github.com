I recently decided to try out [DuckDuckGo](http://www.duckduckgo.com) as the default search engine on my phone. In general I'm not super concerned out Google tracking me. I use Gmail and just started using Google Photos but I also like healthy competition so I figure it's worth checking out. But the feature that really sold me is [bangs!](https://duckduckgo.com/bang). If I'm concerned with the search results I just add !g (or !g) to it and I get the search in Google instead!
