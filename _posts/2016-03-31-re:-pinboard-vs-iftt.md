> We've made mistakes over the past few days both in communication and judgment. I'd like to apologize for those mistakes and attempt to explain our intentions. I also pledge to do everything we can to keep Pinboard on IFTTT.

Looks like the Pinboard following was heard but is it too little too late?

I received an email from IFTTT this afternoon that started with this. I assume it went to all users with Pinboard connected. Surprisingly (or maybe not) this cannot be found on their blog so it seems like contained damage control instead of being open.

I have already setup Zapier with my Pocket to Pinboard link so I won't be rushing to turn IFTTT back on. They'll need to re-earn my service.
