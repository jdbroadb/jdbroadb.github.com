I've been a big fan of IFTT for years. I started using it when it was a new little started. But it sounds like they've been corrupted by venture capital demands and lawyers. I'm strongly considering not using them at all anymore.

I already use [Zapier](https://zapier.com) for some things so may just use them entirely for my web automation needs. Since first finding IFTT I've been interested in these web automation tools but have struggled to find a solid use-case for them. My primary use today is tweeting out my RSS feed for this blog. (Which is already done by Zapier)
