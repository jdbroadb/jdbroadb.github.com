> Editorial is a plain text editor for the iPad with powerful automation tools and a beautiful inline preview for writing Markdown.

I recently purchased [Editorial](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lqks&at=10lqks)[^aflink] for my iPad and it's opened a whole new world of writing and posting from my iPad.

Until recently I've used [Byword](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id482063361?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lqks&at=10lqks)[^aflink] as my Markdown writing solution on both my iPhone and iPad. I'm very happy with using Byword for text only posts with few links. But when the posts require a lot of links and/or photos, the workflow starts to break down. There is a lot of copy/pasting and jumping between apps which is cumbersome and slow. It also requires an addition IAP for Wordpress posting which I haven't sprung for so I have to copy the whole document and paste it into the Wordpress app to post anything.

Editorial allows me to fix those issues and have a much more efficient workflow[^one]. Editorial is a full Markdown editor similar to Byword, but the beauty of Editorial is in its scripting capabilities.

Within the Editorial app you can create custom workflows. These workflows can use a library of built-in functions or can call custom Python scripts when something more specialized is needed. [Federico Viticci of MacStories](http://www.macstories.net/stories/editorial-for-ipad-review/) has a great review that includes all the details on workflows so I won't go into specifics.

I now have workflows in place that can add images to my Wordpress blog, post to the blog, generate Markdown links based on the current built-in browser page, and add affiliate links for iTunes content. This is just the beginning since I've had the app for less than a week. Hopefully I'll post the details of some of the workflows in the future. Needless to say, writing on my iPad is easier than ever and I'm hoping to write a lot more because of it.

I'd definitely recommend Editorial for anyone serious about writing on their iPad. I just wish there was an iPhone version.
