One of my [development ambitions](/2014/05/12/ios-project-reps/) for Reps is to use animations. Just before I posted the Reps introduction I received the latest issue of [objc.io](http://www.objc.io/issue-12/) which is all about animations. Objc.io is an online publication that has monthly issues and has become a must read for objective-c development. I haven't read them all yet but I wish I had. I routinely review them when trying new things. You can subscribe through email, RSS, OSX Safari notifications, and I believe newsstand on iOS.
