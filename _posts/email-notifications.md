I've been struggling with how to set up email notifications on iOS. I use [Mailbox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mailbox/id576502633?mt=8&at=10lqks) as my primary email client with a Gmail account. I like receiving notifications on **select** emails so I can take care of them quickly. But it's important that I don't get notifications for all my email cause that's just overwhelming.

## Old setup
Originally I used Google's exchange option which provided access to all the Google services (email, contacts, & calendar) with push. I then setup Apple's Mail.app to send me notifications for VIP contacts only. Unfortunately, Google discontinued exchange service for free accounts on new devices earlier this year. This meant that when I upgraded to the iPhone 5S I couldn't use my old method anymore.

## Current setup
The standard Apple email client doesn't support push for Google accounts. I could setup the email for fetch, but that uses significant battery to constantly fetch at a reasonable rate for timely notifications.  Mailbox provides push notifications, but it doesn't have any options to filter notifications on select emails. Neither of these options meet my conditions so I was left looking for other notification options.

I've ultimately settled on using the Gmail app as my notification source.  With their recent addition of multiple inboxes, the app provided an option for notifications on the Primary inbox only. This allows for some filtering of notifications, but I generally get notifications for the important stuff.

## It's not perfect
So far it's worked pretty well, but I do get some notifications that I'd rather not see. I try to be diligent about going into Gmail and moving those messages into one of the other inboxes (social or promotions) to try to teach Gmail that these messages shouldn't be in my Primary inbox.

It also means if I select the notification it takes me into the Gmail app. The Gmail app is ok, but I find it somewhat slow and overall it's my least favorite email app of the three (Mailbox, Mail.app, & Gmail).

## The search continues
It's working for me now but this doesn't feel like the ultimate answer. I'll continue to look for alternatives or hope the options improve in Mailbox or Mail.app. The ideal answer for me would be if Mailbox supported Apple's VIP list or Gmail's inboxes for their notifications. I've emailed [Mailbox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mailbox/id576502633?mt=8&at=10lqks) my suggestion but we'll see if that gets anywhere. Overall I've been underwhelmed with my options so please let me know if you've got something better.
