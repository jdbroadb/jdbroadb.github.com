title: Life Without Google Reader

I'm coming to terms with the reality that an alternative to Google Reader must be found, and I am hoping that developers will see this as an opportunity and some great new options will start sprouting up.  I already heard that [David Smith](http://www.david-smith.org) has been planning a new product, [Feed Wrangler](http://www.feedwrangler.net), because there has been a lot of speculation that Google Reader was coming to an end.

## The Search Begins
I decided I can't wait around and hope someone makes a worthy product before July 1.  Instead I need to start looking at the options out there today.  The first service I'll be trying is [feedly](http://www.feedly.com).  They currently offer Google Reader sync support, they have a web interface (but it requires a browser plugin), and an iOS app.  They have also ensured a seamless transition away from Google Reader with their new backend [Normandy](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/).  It's also easy to try out because it's a free options, they have ad's on the web interface.

## First Impression
I just migrated but first impressions are mixed.  I'm not thrilled with the web interface because it almost seems too complicated.  Part of it may just be my affinity for Google Reader so I'm going to stick with it and see if I need to just get used to it.  The iOS app I'm more impressed with and kinda sad I didn't find it earlier.  There are lots of options for how to browse your feeds. I'm still working through all of them, but it's very clean and straightforward which I like.  My biggest concern is that I don't see any sync options which makes me believe that I can't access my feeds without a data connections.  I frequently have connection issues (damn you AT&T) so I like apps that download my content locally so I know it's always available.

## Time Will Tell
I'm not sold yet, I need to give feedly a few weeks to see how it is.  I imagine during that time I'll start hearing about more alternative I can try.  Throughout that time I'll keep providing updates so that by July 1 we should have a good alternative.
