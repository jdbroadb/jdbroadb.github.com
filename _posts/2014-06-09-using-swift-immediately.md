> But my thinking is this: if I start using it now, I can provide feedback, and that feedback will help shape the programming language that I’m likely to use for the rest of my career. Maybe I’ll have a ton of feedback, and maybe I’ll have none — but I’d sure hate to have missed my chance to help.

It looks like Brent's thinking the same as me by embracing Swift immediately. My reasoning is because I don't have any delivered products that use Objective-C and see this as an opportunity to be in at the ground floor of Swift development and the future of iOS/Mac development. I love Brent's reasoning though and am really looking forward to the *Vesper Swift Diaries*.
