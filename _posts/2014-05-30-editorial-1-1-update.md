[Editorial](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lqks&at=10lqks)[^aff]

Editorial released a **major** 1.1 update that could easily be a 2.0. The update included:

1. iOS 7 UI refresh
2. Numerous workflow updates
3. Universal app available on iPhone
4. A full featured UI editor
5. Bug fixes

Number 3 is huge for me and probably was my biggest wish after switching to Editorial on my iPad. Editorial is so much  more than a typical markdown writing app and so the writing workflow is so much smoother. Having that available on my iPhone means a lot because I actually do a fair amount of writing on my phone. And the best part is that [@olemoritz](https://twitter.com/olemoritz) didn't sacrifice functionality in the iPhone version.

As before [@viticci](https://twitter.com/viticci) has a very [comprehensive review](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/editorial-1-1/) so I won't even try.
