This is the inaugural post of my new blog [Coherent Interations](/).  Over the past year I have decided that I wanted to get into iOS and web development and have started researching (on the web), practicing (through a few books), and learning as much as I can.  I've just started to scratch the surface but I'm ready to start applying what I've learned and start making some products.  On this blog I will document my journey as an aspiring part-time developer and explain all the things I learn, all the projects I work on, and all the decisions I need to make along the way.  Throughout the process I expect to learn a lot and hopefully you'll learn something too.  You can learn about me [here](/about) or follow me or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jdbroadb) or [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/jbro).
