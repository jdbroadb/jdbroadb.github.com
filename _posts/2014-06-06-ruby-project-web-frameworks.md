As I mentioned a few times, I don't plan to use [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) for my blogging engine. From everything I've heard Rails is a great framework but it seems to be overkill for my needs, especially since I don't plan to use a database. I just need a simple web app framework, and Rails does not seem simple. Just take a look at the [getting started guide ](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)(which is ironically setting up a blog).

I've done some searching and my initial plan is to use [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com). Sinatra looks to have the right level of control and simplicity. I found their [getting started guide](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html) a bit easiest to follow and feel comfortable this will get me up and running **much** faster.
