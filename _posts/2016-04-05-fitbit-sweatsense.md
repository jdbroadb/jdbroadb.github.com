> Using SweatSense is simple: Just hold your tracker within 6 inches of your area of concern. If your tracker band turns puke green, this indicates that you’re currently emitting a foul odor and should avoid human contact until you can find the nearest shower. In other words, something’s funky, and it ain’t the sounds of a sweet sax solo. 

This sounds terrible. I would think if you want this feature, which seems questionable, that you would at least want the indicator to be discrete. And based in the description it sounds automatic. So every time you itch your armpit everyone gets to find out if you smell bad?!

Update: Don't read the Internet on April 1st.
