As I take on new projects I will document my progress and new things I learn as series of blog posts. The first project series will be about this blog [Coherent Iteration](/).

I just set this site up and have done little to customize it yet. Over time I plan to personalize the site and implement a lot of helpful updates. As you see this site evolve, this series will grow to explain how I did it, why I did it, and what I learned in the process.
