I've been using Google Photos for the last few weeks, and overall I've been very happy. It vastly improves my old picture finding workflow and brings all my photos and videos together where they're organized and searchable. I also like that I can access them from anywhere.

Now that I've been using the service, there are plenty of areas that I feel could use some enhancements. I'll say enhancements instead of improvements because the current product is a solid 1.0. I hope that Google is continuing to invest in further enhancing the product and so these are my suggestions for where to place those efforts.

## 1. Named Faces
This is probably the biggest feature missing for the sole reason that it greatly cripples the amazing search. With named faces I would expect to be able to search for a combination of people, things, and places. This would vastly improve search. Right now things and places can be combined but there is no way to include people into searches. And there is also no way to look for photos with multiple people.

## 2. Favorites
This is a small feature, but I feel it would be incredibly useful. Whenever I'm reviewing through photos I want to easily pick out the best ones. These are the ones I'd like to share with others or use in creations later.

## 3. Date Editing
After importing the last ~20 years of photos, unsurprisingly I found we have a bunch of old photos with bad date tags. We probably didn't set the date on the camera and now all those photos fall on the same date/time. I need to be able to edit them to be more accurate.

## 4. Geotag Editing
We also have tons on photos that weren't taken with our cell phones and so have no geotags. It would be great to add tags to all our trip photos so they show up in place searches with the phone pics.

## 5. Album-Story Linkage
Currently albums and stories are two separate things but it's common to want to organize all your photos from a trip but also create a story for it. I'd like to be able to generate stories off albums and keep them linked so if the album gets updated, so does the story.

## 6. Album/Creation List in Photo Details
Photos should know which albums and creations they are within. It would be great from the photo details to get a list of all the places that photo is used and have the ability to jump to those places.

## 7. Collage Editing
Collages have limited controls. The ability to pick layouts and crop/align photos during collage creation is essential. The ability to edit later is a bonus.

## 8. Update Creation Photos
Photo selection for all creations appears to be done once and then set forever. If I end up with more photos to include, particularly for stories, I want to add them without creating a new story. This would at least be solved for stories with #5.

## 9. Search/Albums in Creation Selection
Finding photos for creations is extremely cumbersome. The only option is to scroll through the timeline. Adding search and albums to the selection would greatly improve creation selection. *After writing this I realized creations can be created by selecting photos and then hitting plus, instead of hitting plus and then selecting photos. This helps but I still believe adding the features to the normal creation method would help.*

## 10. Story Max Photos
This is something I ran into when trying to create trip stories that span multiple days. I don't want stories for each day of the trip. But as trips get longer the photo count rises. I had trouble beyond about 1000 photos. That seems like a lot, but on a site-seeing vacation that's nothing. I also encountered the same issue trying to create a story for our wedding. This is another one that could be resolved with #5.
