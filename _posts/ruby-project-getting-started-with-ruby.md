When starting to learn a new language I always try to find a few solid sources to reference. Typically that includes some websites and a book or two. In my recent[^lastyear] searching I found two books that consistently came up and had great reviews:

* [Pickaxe](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-2-0-Programmers/dp/1937785491/ref=zg_bs_6134006011_5?tag=coherit-20)[^aff] - This seems to be **the book** on the Ruby language. It's actually called *Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide (The Facets of Ruby)* but it's referred to as Pickaxe due to the cover art. I've started reading it and I like Dave Thomas's writing style. I'm also finding that I like the Ruby language so far.
* [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Rails-Tutorial-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321832051/ref=zg_bs_6134006011_6?tag=coherit-20)[^aff2] - The plan is to not use Ruby on Rails for the blog engine, but it would definitely be a consideration for any larger web service. This book is actually available for free through [railstutorial.org](http://www.railstutorial.org/book) but I like having the books for reference so I picked up a copy off Amazon. I'll be planning to look at this books over the summer after finishing the blog engine and reading Pickaxe.

As I start working on the blog engine I'm expecting to find a bunch of good web resources which I'll continue to link to.

[^lastyear]: I started looking into Ruby last year and actually got the books for Christmas
