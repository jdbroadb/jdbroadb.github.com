If you read my [recent post](/2014/05/20/web-project-ruby-blog/), you may be asking, "Why self-host a VPS"? I could be using a service like [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/) or  [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). That's what smart people like [Brent Simmons](http://inessential.com/2014/03/27/on_running_your_own_servers_and_why_we) is using for Vesper Sync and [Casey Liss](http://www.caseyliss.com/2014/5/1/heroku-first-impressions) used for his recent Node.js blog. I think that's a great question and one I thought about a lot.  This was my final answer.

> It's important to make conscious decisions

I could easily use those services and come up with a list of *good* reasons to convince myself:

* It's quicker to learn
* It's faster to deploy
* It's easier to scale
* I'll save time because I don't have to administer the servers

But it's also the more expensive solution, particularly for larger web services. And I'm not confident all those reasons above are true. So I need to learn more and there is no better way to learn than to do.

With inspiration from [Marco's post](http://www.marco.org/2014/03/27/web-hosting-for-app-developers) a couple months ago, I'm going to setup a self-managed VPS and ultimately deploy my new blog there. Once I've gone through the process and appreciate what it really means, I'll be better equipped to decide how the pros and cons weigh out.

I shopped around some and the best deal I could find was [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=5b9d90caaff6)[^aff] who offers a low-end VPS option for $5 a month (or $0.007 per hour). I also was able to find a coupon code for a $10 credit with a quick Google search. Since I don't plan to leave the VPS deployed until everything's done, that's **a lot** of hours to play around with and learn.

Stay tuned for more posts on deploying the VPS in addition to the design and coding of my new blogging engine.
