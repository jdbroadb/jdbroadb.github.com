title: Shift In Focus
---

I started CI over 5 years ago with the hopes of regularly posting about my progress and learning in web and iOS development. And while, at times, I’ve spent a lot of time learning and working on those things, I’ve never gotten into a good writing rhythm. I attribute that partly to the fact that I barely could get into a good rhythm working on those things and so had even less time writing about them. Also, my focus has changed of late and I haven’t spent much time on development recently. 

With that said I want to write more and document the things I’m thinking about and learning. After all that is the origin of my site name. To combine the things I learn, as I iterate through life, in a coherent way as to result in self improvement. So in an attempt to write more, I plan to shift the focus of this site and generalize it to all things I’m learning and thinking about.
