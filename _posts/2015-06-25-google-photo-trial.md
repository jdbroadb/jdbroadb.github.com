I was very excited to hear about the Google Photos announcement. My current photo workflow is as follows:

1. Take photos and videos with my phone, my wife's phone, or our D5100
2. iPhones sync to our Synology over SFTP using PhotoSync
3. D5100 is synced to our PC and if we feel especially organized get moved to the Synology
4. Then photos and videos are deleted off devices because we need space
5. Everything is backed up to Crashplan
6. Only look at photos occasionally because they are cumbersome to find
7. Repeat

In general this isn't actually a horrible workflow. It ensures we have hard copies stored on our Synology which has local redundancy and in Crashplan for offsite backup. Running PhotoSync on our phones occasional is very easy and runs relatively quickly on the 5GHz network. The problem is finding and enjoying photos and videos.

We've considered trying out Apple's new Photos solution but I'm hesitant to jump in giving some of the shortcomings and the cost. We currently have approximately 160k photos and videos. Yes you read the correctly. At least that's what the Google Photo backup utility claims. That's a lot of storage and it constantly is growing from the continuous pictures and videos we take on a daily basis of our son. That would immediately put me in the 1TB bracket for Apple.

My workflow with Apple Photos is also not clear to me. For starters I'd need to put all the hard copies into the photos library which can't easily be on my Synology. Since we only have 120 GB MacBook Airs we can't store all the photos locally. Which means all our photos would need to be backed up to the Synology anyway or place all our trust in Apple web services. And I still don't even know exactly how the backup workflow would go.

With Google Photos it is clear. Keep my existing workflow. Let the backup utility and iOS apps push all my photos and videos to Google Photos. Use the free tier and live with the compression. I still have all the originals on the Synology exactly how I did before. None of our current cameras are over 16 megapixels so we don't even have to worry about the resolution reduction (for now). Now we can use Google Photos to resolve all of our photo viewing, finding, enjoying issues. In addition all our photos can be accessed from anywhere.
