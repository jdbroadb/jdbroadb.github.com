> Second, I find myself triggering the Quick Action menu inadvertently when I want to enter “jiggle mode” on the home screen, to either delete or move an app. Tap-and-wait long-pressing has always been a little frustrating to me. I don’t like to wait. I’m impatient. So when I go to move an app on the iPhone 6S, I press on it, and more often than not, I press hard enough to register as a 3D Touch.

This was my first experience with 3D Touch. Since I've explored many of Gruber's other examples and find them extremely clever. I suspect this will become one of my favorite new features, but my first experience was not the best.
