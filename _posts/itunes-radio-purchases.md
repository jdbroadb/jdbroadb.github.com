I've been using iTunes Radio fairly regularly for the last couple weeks with the iOS 7 beta. Overall I've been happy. While it's nothing ground-breaking, performance seems comparable to Pandora and the integration into the Music app is convenient. I'm also an iTunes Match subscriber which means no ads, which I love. It also means **I'll never buy music directly from iTunes Radio**.

Bear with me while I provide context and then I'll come back to my declaration. Over the years I've collected a lot of music. It's come from many sources but last year I compiled it all and decided to get iTunes Match. It's been great cause I can easily access all my music from everywhere.  While my primary music store is iTunes, I still get music from other sources such as the occasionally Amazon deal and my weekly Freegal downloads. Match allows me to add this music from anywhere and access it everywhere. And I'm not the only person adding music. My wife is constantly adding music as well, which means its hard to keep track of what we already own.

This brings me back to my declaration. **I'll never buy music directly from iTunes Radio**. One of the *features* and certainly selling points to the music industry is the "buy now" button on the Radio screen. Whenever listening to music it will show the price to buy the current track. If you already own the track it provides a button to download the track instead. That's all fine, but while occasionally Radio will correctly identify tracks I own, more often **it provides the purchase button instead**.

I believe the issue is two fold:

1. There appears to be no Radio - Match integration. Even if the track is matched it still provides a purchase button.
2. The recognition even for iTunes purchased track is not nearly aggressive enough. If you bought the Deluxe version of the album because it has a few extra tracks but Radio is playing the track from the "non-deluxe" album. It shows a purchase button even though the track is identical to the one you already purchased through iTunes.

So I am left with the constant fear that any time I push the purchase button, I may already own that track. While any single instance of double purchase isn't too devistating, the constant reality that it's possible means I just won't use the feature. I'll continue to buy my music the way I do today by laborously checking my library before each purchase and Apple will see no increase in my music buying habits even though I've fully embraced using the Radio service.

I suggest they make these fixes fast cause slowly others will encounter the same issues and will quickly stop using the *feature* as well.
