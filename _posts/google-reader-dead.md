<p>This is a sad day.  Google Reader is being shut down in three months.  I use Google Reader daily to get all my news and to keep up with all the blogs I follow.  Even when I'm using other programs to read blogs, Google Reader is still the syncing back end between them.  Today the hunt for a new alternative begins.  Let me know if you find a worthy one.</p>
