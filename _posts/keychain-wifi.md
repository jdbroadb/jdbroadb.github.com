Did you know that iCloud Keychain also stores all of your known wi-fi networks. It's a feature I hadn't heard about but loved over the holidays.

I got a new iPad Mini w/ Retina for my birthday earlier this month and took it to my in-laws and parents over the last few weeks. I was surprised and delighted when I turned it on and it immediately connected to their wi-fi networks.  It made the experience of using a new device seemless. While typing in wireless passwords isn't the biggest inconvenience, it still is a pain to ask everyone for their passwords again. This year it wasn't an issue.

For many it's probably something that went unnoticed. They turned on their devices and started using them without realizing how it happened or that something even happened.  I think that's a sign of a great feature.
