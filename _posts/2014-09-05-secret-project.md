A couple months ago I deployed[^1] [Dais](http://www.coherentiterations.com/2014/07/07/introducing-dais), my Ruby blogging engine based on the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) framework.  This was half of my goals when I [started projects](http://www.coherentiterations.com/2014/05/07/starting-projects) back in May. I also had planned to deliver an [iOS application](http://www.coherentiterations.com/2014/05/12/ios-project-reps). After finishing Dais I was extremely excited about Ruby and my larger secret project so instead of working on Reps I've spent my time learning more Ruby and reading the [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book).

At this time I think I have the tools to pursuit my bigger goals and so I've decided to stop working on Reps. One of my goals with Dais and Reps was to have full disclosure of the things I learned along the way. I have a whole series of posts on Dais that I still plan to write, but I don't plan to be so forthcoming with my new project. I will however still write about the things I learn. My posts will just be more general and without specific examples from my project.

[^1]: I didn't say shipped because for now it's just a personal project for this blog.
