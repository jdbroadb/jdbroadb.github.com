WWDC was this week and Apple had A LOT of big announcements for developers. Because of the announcements I've decided to add two more items to my [Reps development scope](/2014/05/12/ios-project-reps/):

* **Swift** - Since Reps is a pretty small app it seems like the perfect time to try out Apple's new language. The only issues may be that the language is still in flux which may result in some rework and it means the app won't be releasable until the Fall. But realistically I doubt it'll be completely ready before then.
* **Storyboards**-  I already plan to use Interface Builder and AutoLayout. With Apple's latest talk there seems be a strong push for these tools and Storyboards fits right in. This app probably lends itself well to Storyboard so it seems like a good time to try.
